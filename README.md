# LiviUtils - a utility Obsidian plugin

This is a utility plugin that adds misc. QoL and utility features to Obsidian. They're all bundled in a single plugin to save time if I ever bother submitting this to the official plugin repo, since Obsidian's review time is absurd.

## Features

* [Arbitrary file embedding (including canvases)](docs/features/FileEmbedding.md)

## Installing and getting started

See [Getting started](./docs/Getting-started.md)
