# Obsidian utils

This is a utility plugin that adds misc. features to Obsidian. They're all bundled in a single plugin to save time of I ever bother submitting this to the official plugin repo, since Obsidian's review time is absurd.


## Features

* [Arbitrary file embedding (including canvases)](docs/feats/FileEmbedding.md)

## Installation

### Manually

From Releases on GitHub, download the bundled .zip file, unzip it and drop it into your vault (`.obsidian/plugins/livi-utils`)

### Via BRAT 

BRAT might also work, but has not been tested. If it doesn't work, consider opening an issue.
