# Getting started

## Installation

### Manually

From [Releases](https://github.com/LunarWatcher/obsidian-utils/releases) on GitHub, download the bundled .zip file, unzip it and drop it into your vault (`.obsidian/plugins/livi-utils`). You can also download the individual files manually; it's all the same files, but the `.zip` is shipped for more convenient manual use.

If you prefer, you can alternatively [download a nightly version](https://github.com/LunarWatcher/obsidian-utils/actions/workflows/build.yml), though these aren't as stable as versioned releases.

### Via BRAT 

BRAT might also work, but has not been tested. If it doesn't work, consider opening an issue.

### Obsidian plugin registry [not supported yet]

Because of Obsidian's ridiculously slow review cycle, this plugin may or may not be in the registry within 6-12 months. Until then, use BRAT or install manually.

## Next steps

Because this is a plugin of plugins, there isn't just one way to get started with the plugin. See `docs/features` (or on the rendered mkdocs website, see the Features tab in the sidebar)
